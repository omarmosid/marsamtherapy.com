Hopeful but annoyed, really considering where am I going, or maybe I'm truly lost. Is life supposed to feel this way; who can verify but God? Sometimes I want to flee, to run away, sometimes I just want to stay - fixed and unmoving.

Sometimes there's immense sadness, other times there's immense joy. This swing I sway in, doesn't give me a break, it's a life long ride - sweet and volatile.

## Finding Balance

A predilection for a better me, who is not swayed so easily. But then I think, isn't that the whole deal?

To be swayed and still know your place, to be moved and still be assured of knowing where you belong, to be poked and prodded by life and still have a smile because otherwise you wouldn't bat an eye.

## Life's Purpose

Life is on our side, it may expand and constrict us, all day, yet it hopes we build our capacity - our real potential to become and Be.

Isn't life amazing, I think to myself, **it only wants the Best for us** - how would we know the Best without seeing the Worst in ourselves?
