Today is a good day to write about all the lovely things in life.

Today is a day to remember many splendid smiles,

Today is a day full of gratitude and love.

I see those frowns turning upside down,

I see those dimples getting more obvious,

I see that gaze getting lighter and lovelier.

Sometimes all I want to do is protect you

The world never went easy even on a few

You have come through, with a fierce force

The days look calmer, the sun has a different glow

You look at the sky and wonder how is the snow

As time passes by, you witness yourself grow

So many times we have stumbled and fallen

Never backing down against the darkness

Be proud today for all that you have overcome

Some days will remind you the beauty of truth

Other days will beckon you to become what you loath

Cherish the challenges, they guide you to peace and love

After all the decay and the sadness

came so much strength and will power

you have come so far, be proud, a Lil'
