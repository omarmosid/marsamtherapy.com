## Understanding Anxiety

Anxiety is one of the most common mental health challenges, affecting millions of people. While some anxiety is normal and even helpful, excessive worry can interfere with your daily life, relationships, and well-being.

### Common Anxiety Symptoms

## Evidence-Based Strategies

I use proven techniques to help you manage anxiety:
